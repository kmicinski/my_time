===========

I'm starting to read more about Rails and Ruby:

- Stevie and I want to work on a formal semantics for Ruby.

- I am reading the "Ruby Metaprogramming" book.

- I need to review a paper for Mike: I am planning to read the paper
  tomorrow on a flight and then write the review tomorrow night.

- I also want to generally learn more Rails coding, I am going to read
  one chapter of the Rails book a day.

- I am also working on the Android time tracking app.  Eventually, I
  would like to turn this into an app which also talks to a web
  backend.

- For the web backend, I'm going to use Yesod.  I'm planning to
  implement the backend using Haskell using Yesod and then interfacing
  it with the actual Android app using a REST API.
