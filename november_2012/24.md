===================

- Yesterday I spent a long time traveling on the plane, etc..,

- I read a chapter of the Nielsen and Nielsen book on Control Flow
  Analysis, but stopped mostly at section 3.3.  I want to eventually
  reread the first two sections and then write up notes on those.

- I need to start working on the higher order Android project today:
  + I want to find a Java S Expression parser.
  + Then I want to start a write up of the ways that intents are 
    used in Android.
  + Then I also want to start writing up the PDF document with the 
    formalization of the semantics.
  + I also need to start the Java library that actually implements 
    the higher order intent framework.  I will probably make this a 
    drop in replacement for the system classes to start, and then 
    see how we can expand from there.
 
- I need to get more caught up in math, I plan to look at the
  homework, and then spend two hours digging through the notes to
  catch myself more up with the class.
  
- Lily is coming over for dinner later and we are going to make some
  Italian dish.

- I also need to start looking through the Ruby interpreter for the
  project I'm working on with Stevie.
