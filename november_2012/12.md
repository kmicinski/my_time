Monday, November, 12th
======================

- Went to math class, felt mostly confused, still do not understand
  most of the material relating to Stone spaces.  Really need to look
  this up, will put some in time tomorrow morning (optimially..)

- Small fixes to the slides on functional programming and the CPS
  transform for Jeff's class.

- Worried about finishing my math homework for this week (due on
  Thursday).

- Wrote up more sections on adversarial model for Jeff.

- Browsed through Matt Might's post on order theory, reminded me that
  I need to look again through the program analysis book, budget some
  time to do this over Thanksgiving.
